# TwitchController-v1.3 aka Twitch Plays Bot

***NEWEST VERSION*** <br/>
Last Updated 1/12/2022
<br/>
I've had a new deisre to work on this project again, i'm hoping to understand twitches API and make this so much better<br/>
And potentially work in even more programming languages such as JS and C#<br/>
If I get those working then this bot will be even more useful!<br/>
